# Text Summarization with a Fine-Tuned LLM

In this project, I load a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tune it for the task of text summarization.

All code is implemented in the Jupyter notebook ``text_summarization.ipynb``, using the PyTorch framework for Python with Hugging Face Transformers.

## Environment

The environment configuration is provided for reproducibility:

* ``environment.yml`` - for setting up with Conda.
* ``requirements.txt`` - for installing dependencies with pip.
